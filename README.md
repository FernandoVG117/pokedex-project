# POKEDEX.
Welcome to the presentation of my project, a Pokédex developed in React. This project aims to offer an interactive and dynamic experience for Pokémon enthusiasts, allowing users to explore and learn about their favorite Pokémon in an efficient and user-friendly way.


## Project Description.
The Pokédex is a web application built using React, a JavaScript library known for making it easier to create interactive user interfaces. Our application not only lists Pokémon but also offers customized functionalities to enhance the user experience.

## Main Features.
1. **Trainer Name Entry:** At the start of the application, users are prompted to enter their name as a Pokémon trainer. This feature personalizes the experience, making the interaction with the Pokédex more personal and meaningful.
